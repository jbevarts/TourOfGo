notes: very clear of thought


who was your customer?
- internal customers
- various departments within
- ** actively listen, understand needs**
- help desk lots of experience.

frustration:
- ad went down
- as long as they are in the loop
- nobody could auth, over communciation etc.
- hand holding

pushing back on customer:
- covid app
- 

overqualified and a little slow

worked on small teams, basically gets requirements.
then fixes after the fact.

small examples, trivial, not very technical.

a little negative, snarky

Good problem solving( he was able to see jist of solution faster than expected and had other problems he called to for comparisons), able to show knowledge of data structures and java, was able to solve problem given minor assistance.  w.r.t Delierving Results, i feel he presented a desire to focus on quality over delivering quickly, but i think was some naivety.  This is first job out of college.  3/5.

6/23:

- create POC for roman and guest services for using TLS + aad tokens 

daniel: java: 6, Problem: 7 results: 6
- pretty good 
- prefers quality over shipping
Rushil: java: 7, Problem: 5.5
- bit all over, not great at taking feedback
Abbie: java: 5, Problem: 6 : results 8
Shahawn: python: 7, problem: 7, results: 7

Notes for biswarup:
-- create subscription task only works on azure pipelines
-- slot creation task works on SelfHostedBooking
-- if infra is rebuilt, the subscription to ocrsroomresv topic breaks


** application properties files **
-- for logging.
